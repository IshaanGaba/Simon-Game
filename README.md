# Simon-Game


The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game designed to test and improve a player's memory and concentration skills. 

The Simon game typically consists of a circular console with four large, colored buttons. Each button represents a unique color: red, blue, green, and yellow. The console also features a built-in speaker.

The primary objective of the Simon game is to remember and replicate a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the console. The game starts with a simple sequence and progressively becomes more challenging as the player advances.

Game Rules:

1.The game begins with the Simon console lighting up one or more buttons in a particular sequence, accompanied by a corresponding sound.

2.The player must carefully observe and remember the sequence of illuminated buttons.

3.The player then has to repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.

4.If the player replicates the sequence correctly, the game advances to the next level, which adds a new color to the sequence, making it longer.

5.If the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or in the wrong order and the game ends.
